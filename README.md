## Description:
Coral reef ecosystems and the services that we derive from them are in decline globally, underscoring the need for data-driven and cost-effective management approaches. In response, management actions and policies are being considered to reduce current anthropogenic threats, restore aspects of the ecosystem that have been lost, and increase system resilience. Weighing potential management interventions is significantly aided by a detailed understanding of the key factors controlling species’ abundances, the current status of species’ populations, and the likely outcomes of management initiatives. The aims of this study were to assess the relative importance of biophysical and anthropogenic factors on reef fishes, map fish biomass along the reef tract, and evaluate how various common management interventions might impact fish populations along the Florida reef tract. Using nearly three thousand fish surveys from coral reef habitats, we first modelled fishing impact using snapper and grouper species biomass as a proxy for the effects of fishing. Estimated fishing impact was then combined with 18 biophysical variables to model the current biomass of all reef fish species, the snapper-grouper species complex, grazing species, and species collected for aquaria. Generally, the biomass of fished species decreased with increasing fishing impact, and all species groups were also affected by biophysical factors and especially by benthic complexity. The statistical models allowed the production of high-resolution maps of current fish biomass, as well as maps of potential biomass under different management scenarios: a no-take marine reserve, moderate and extensive coral restoration, and the addition of artificial structure. The addition of structure was predicted to have the largest single impact on fish biomass of different species groups (23-73% increase compared to 5-22% following cessation of fishing). Additionally, our results point to beneficial synergies that occurred when combining habitat-based management with limits on fishing, with some combinations resulting in as much as a 90% increase in biomass. We highlight reef areas with large potential for fish biomass increases and suggest that conservation tools aimed at protecting structural complexity of reefs should remain an important part of the fishery management discussion, but that ways of increasing this complexity should be more widely considered.
